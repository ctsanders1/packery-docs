<p>For commercial applications and projects, you may use Packery by making a one-time purchase of commercial license.

<h3>Open source license</h3>

<p>For non-commercial, personal, or open-source applications and projects, Packery is MIT Licensed. You may use Packery for free.</p>

<h3>What is commercial considered?</h3>

<p>If you are paid to do your job, and part of your job is implementing Packery, a commercial license is required.</p>

<h2>Commercial licensing</h2>

<p>The commercial license comes in two varieties:</p>

<h3>Packery Commercial Developer License</h3>

<p>The Packery Commercial Developer License is for individual developers. A developer is someone who implements Packery, and probably types <code>new Packery</code> at some point. This license is priced per developer. Each individual developer needs to purchase a separate license.</p>

<h3>Packery Commercial Organization License</h3>

<p>The Packery Commercial Organization License is for an organization with a team of developers. The license covers the entire team no matter how many developers are working on it.</p>

<p>With the purchase of a commercial license:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Once purchased, you may use Isotope in all your future commercial applications.</li>
  <li>You may use Packery in your own commercial applications, i.e. WordPress, Tumblr, or other CMS themes or templates.</li>
  <li>Customers of your products do not need to purchase their own license.</li>
</ul>
