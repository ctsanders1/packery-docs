<p>Packery may be used in commercial projects and applications with the one-time purchase of a commercial license.</p>

<h3>Open source license</h3>

<p>For non-commercial, personal, or open source projects and applications, you may use Packery under the terms of the MIT License. You may use Packery for free.</p>

<h3>What is commercial considered?</h3>

<p>If you are paid to do your job, and part of your job is implementing Packery, a commercial license is required.</p>

<h2 id="commercial-licensing">Commercial licensing</h2>

<p>With the purchase of a commercial license:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You may use Packery in as many commercial applications you like.</li>
  <li>You may use Packery in your own commercial applications and products. For example: premium WordPress, Tumblr, or other CMS themes or templates.</li>
  <li>Customers of your products do not need to purchase their own license &mdash; so long as they are not developing their own commercial products with Packery.</li>
</ul>

<p>The commercial license comes in two varieties:</p>


<h3>Packery Commercial Developer License</h3>
